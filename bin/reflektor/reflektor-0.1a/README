reflek:tor is alternate automation software for use with the Violet
mir:ror consumer RFID reader. It replaces, for Linux systems, Violet's
own mirware.

Please keep in mind that reflek:tor is still alpha software: this
release is intended for developers and advanced end users, and as
such, may have bugs and vagaries of use which may take some getting used
to. Better than getting used to them, why not let me know (see AUTHORS)
so I can fix them for the next release?

How to Use reflek:tor
1. $> ./configure && make && sudo make install
2. Plug in mir:ror.
3. $> reflektor
4. Scan a tag or two. It'll leave both "show" and "hide" events in
	.reflektor_do in your HOME directory. You can modify the portion
	after the colon to whatever you will. I recommend creating a
	${HOME}/bin/violet directory and storing scripts there, to avoid
	having anything terribly complex in .reflektor_do.
5. Scan tags you've created scripted actions for, and watch the magic!
